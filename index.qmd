## Time series

A time series is a sequence of observations taken sequentially in time.

## Time series data vs Cross sectional data

**Time series data:** a set of observations, along with some information about what times those observations were recorded.

**Cross sectional data:** observations that come from different individuals or groups at a single point in time.

## Deterministic vs Non-deterministic time series

**Deterministic time series:** future values can be exactly determined by using some mathematical function.

**Non-deterministic time series:** future values can be determined only in terms of a probability distribution.

## Stochastic processes

"A statistical phenomenon that evolves in time according to probabilistic laws is called a stochastic process." (Box, George EP, et al. Time series analysis: forecasting and control.)

## Non-deterministic time series or statistical time series

A sample realization from an infinite population of time series that could have been generated by a stochastic process.

# Your turn

 What are the frequencies for a monthly time series with semi-annual and annual pattern?

---

## Time series patterns

**Trend**

Long-term increase or decrease in the data.

**Seasonal**

A seasonal pattern exists when a series is influenced by seasonal factors (e.g., the quarter of the year, the month, or day of the week). Seasonality is always of a fixed and known period. Hence, seasonal time series are sometimes called periodic time series.

Period is unchanging and associated with some aspect of the calendar.

---

**Cyclic**

- A cyclic pattern exists when data exhibit rises and falls that are not of fixed period. The duration of these fluctuations is usually of at least 2 years.
In general,

- the average length of cycles is longer than the length of a seasonal pattern.

- the magnitude of cycles tends to be more variable than the magnitude of seasonal patterns.
